# Duel! Rock-Paper-Scissors
http://rps.raygye.ga

Frontend for "Duel! Rock-Paper-Scissors" website. Made with React.js.
The website features personalized user profiles with win/loss statistics
and personalized images. 

Feel the freedom of finally being able to play rock paper scissors with
your friends online. 

When my friends and I were on Discord, we would sometimes settle petty arguments
by playing rock-paper-scissors by sending a message at the same time. I decided
to provide a solution.

If you wish for a demo, feel free to contact me and I'll send you an ngrok link.
